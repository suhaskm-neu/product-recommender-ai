# Predicting the Next Item for Each User

In this project, you are given user-item interaction on an ecommerce site. The user
views each item sequentially. Your goal is to build an intelligent system to predict the
item among the given items that the user will view. In this dataset, each user will have
the timespan to view each item and click rate for each item.
In this e-commerce site, some users are friends of each other. There might be some
social networks among them.

## Intelligent System Requirement:
1. Must have a component to train machine learning/deep learning model(s).
2. Must be able to save the machine learning/deep learning model(s).
3. Must be able to perform inference with the machine learning/deep learning
model(s).
4. Visualization of the results/findings is encouraged but optional.


## Report requirement:
1. Documentation of the architecture of the system (i.e. system design, business
requirements, etc.)
2. Documentation of how you come up with machine learning/deep learning
models.
3. Copy of your code(s).
4. NO jupyter notebook.
5. Visualization of the result(s) if you have.
