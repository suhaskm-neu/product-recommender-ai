# Next Item Prediction System

## Overview
This system predicts the next item a user will interact with based on their historical behavior and preferences.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Data Preparation
- Load and preprocess user-item interaction data
- Sort interactions by user and timestamp
- Create 'next_item_id' target by shifting item sequences
- Encode categorical features (user_id, item_id)
- Split data into training and testing sets

### 2. Model Training
- Implement multiple models for comparison:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Track experiments with MLflow
- Log parameters, metrics, and models

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Basic features: user_id, item_id, timestamp, view_time
- Derived features: click_rate, binary engagement targets
- Experiment with additional features to improve performance

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Analyze performance across different user segments
- Select best performing model for deployment

### 5. Prediction Scenarios

#### For Existing Users
- Leverage complete interaction history
- Personalize recommendations based on past behavior

#### For User Groups
- Identify similar user clusters
- Generate group-specific recommendations
- Balance individual preferences with group trends

#### For New Users (Cold Start)
- Implement popularity-based fallback strategy
- Utilize available demographic or contextual information
- Gradually incorporate feedback as user interactions increase
